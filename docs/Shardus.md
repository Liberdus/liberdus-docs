# 🖧 Shardus

## 🧭 Overview

**Shardus** is the underlying distributed ledger framework that powers **Liberdus**. It was created to solve the **scalability, efficiency, and decentralization** limitations of earlier blockchain designs.  

Unlike conventional blockchains that bundle transactions into blocks, **Shardus uses a blockless, sharded architecture** that allows transactions to be processed **individually and in parallel** across thousands of nodes.

This design enables **linear scalability**, as more nodes join the network, total throughput increases proportionally, while maintaining decentralization and **low resource requirements per node**.

Importantly, Shardus is not confined to Liberdus alone. It serves as a framework for building **Application Specific Chains (ASCs)**; independent, self-governing decentralized networks designed for different use cases.  
Liberdus is one such implementation, focused on **private, censorship-resistant social communication**.

## 💡 Why Liberdus Chose Shardus

Liberdus is not just a payment or communication network — it’s a **social messaging infrastructure** that must handle message volumes comparable to mainstream apps like **WhatsApp or Telegram**, while remaining **decentralized, censorship-resistant, and trustless**.

Shardus was chosen because:

🔹 **It ensures transaction fees remain low forever.**  
Unlike most blockchain platforms, where transaction costs **rise massively as they near their TPS limits**, Shardus’s **linearly scaling architecture** ensures that fees stay consistently low regardless of demand. This makes it ideal for a global-scale messenger that must remain affordable for all users.

🔹 **It supports millions of transactions per second** through **compute and state sharding**, essential for handling large-scale message traffic.

🔹 **It provides low latency and immediate finality**, which allows **near-instant message delivery confirmation**.

🔹 **It maintains high decentralization** by keeping **node resource requirements low**, encouraging wide participation and preventing centralization of power.

🔹 **It’s blockless**, removing the batching delays and scalability bottlenecks found in traditional blockchains.

🔹 **It’s energy-efficient**, avoiding Proof-of-Work while maintaining robust consensus through its **Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ)** algorithm.

🔹 **It offers auto-scaling**, allowing the network to **dynamically adjust its node count and capacity** as usage grows.

For Liberdus, these properties translate directly into **fast, censorship-resistant, and privacy-preserving messaging** that can **scale globally** without relying on centralized servers — and without ever pricing out users through fee inflation.

## 💬 Why It Matters for Decentralized Messaging

Shardus enables Liberdus to achieve what centralized messengers cannot:

- **Decentralized architecture** means no central server can censor or surveil conversations.  
- **Linear scalability** means message traffic scales *with* users, not *against* them.  
- **Auto-scaling and low node costs** mean global participation is **practical, not theoretical**.  
- **Permanently low fees** ensure long-term accessibility, regardless of network size or activity level.  

In essence, **Shardus transforms decentralized messaging from an ideal into an implementable system** — allowing **Liberdus** to function as a **fully peer-to-peer network** where **privacy, scalability, and openness coexist** harmoniously.
