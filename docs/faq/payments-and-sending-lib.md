# Payments & Sending LIB

### 1. Does Liberdus have a built-in wallet?

Yes. Liberdus includes a built-in wallet that generates your address and lets you send and receive LIB directly inside the app.

### 2. Can I send payments in Liberdus?

Yes, Liberdus supports peer-to-peer (P2P) payments that can be sent alongside memos or as standalone transactions. Payments are fast, decentralized, and secured by cryptographic signatures.

### 3. What currencies does Liberdus support?

Liberdus primarily uses LIB tokens for transactions. Other tokens may be supported in the future, but multi-token compatibility is not currently implemented.

### 4. Can I swap tokens in Liberdus?

No, Liberdus does not support native token swaps within the app. However, LIB tokens can be swapped externally on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.

### 5. How does the toll system work for payments?

If a recipient has set a toll, the sender must pay a fee to message them. The toll payment is held in escrow until the recipient reads and replies to the message. If the recipient does not reply, the sender gets refunded, minus a small network fee. Users can set custom toll amounts or disable tolls entirely.

### 6. Do I need LIB tokens to use Liberdus for messaging?

Yes, sending messages requires a small transaction fee in LIB tokens to prevent spam. However, if the recipient has not set a toll, the fee is minimal.

### 7. How long does it take for a transaction to be processed?

Liberdus transactions are designed to be fast and efficient. Since the network scales with demand, transactions typically process within seconds.

### 8. Can I make payments anonymously?

Currently, LIB transactions are not anonymous and contain metadata such as which account sent to another account, the amount sent etc. However, the account is still anonymous in the sense that no one will know who these accounts are.

### 9. Can I refund a payment?

Payments cannot be reversed once confirmed. However, the recipient can choose to refund the amount manually.

### 10. Can I see my payment history?

You can see you received and sent LIB in the history section on the app.

### 11. What happens if I send a payment to a non-existent username?

Payments can only be sent to registered Liberdus usernames or valid wallet addresses. If the username does not exist, the transaction will not be processed.

### 12. Can I earn LIB tokens by using Liberdus?

Yes! Users can earn LIB tokens by: receiving payments for messages (if they set a toll), running validator nodes and staking, and providing liquidity on DEXs (LP staking).

### 13. How do QR code payments work?

Liberdus supports QR code-based payments, allowing users to generate a QR code linked to their username or wallet address and scan a QR code to instantly send a payment.

### 14. Can I integrate my existing crypto wallet with Liberdus?

This is not possible currently as Liberdus is not a wallet.
