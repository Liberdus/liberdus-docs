# Toll

### 1. What is a Toll in Liberdus?
A Toll is a small sender-paid fee required when messaging someone who has not added you as a Friend or Connection. It protects users from spam and ensures messages are meaningful.

### 2. Why does Liberdus use Tolls instead of filtering spam like other apps?
Traditional platforms allow free messaging, which invites mass spam. Liberdus adds an economic cost to unsolicited messages, making spam expensive and protecting users. It also lets you monetize your attention instead of the platform.

### 3. When do I have to pay a Toll?
You only pay a Toll if the recipient has set you as Tolled, or if they haven't added you as a Friend or Connection.

### 4. What if I added someone as a Friend, but they didn’t add me back?
You still must pay the Toll until they add you as a Friend or Connection. Your settings only affect their messages to you; not the other way around.

### 5. How much is the minimum Toll?
The minimum toll is $0.10 USD. You cannot set a lower toll amount. However, you can disable tolls entirely by changing the toll amount to $0 USD.

### 6. How is the toll amount paid? What currency is used?
You enter the Toll value in USD, and Liberdus automatically converts it into LIB at the current market price.

### 7. Where can I change my Toll amount?
Go to: `Settings` → `Toll` → `Set New Toll Amoun` → `Save Changes`

### 8. Can I turn tolls off completely?
Yes. Setting your toll to 0 USD disables tolls and lets anyone message you freely.

### 9. What happens when someone pays a Toll to message me?
When you read the message, you receive 50% of the toll. When you reply, you receive the remaining 50%.

### 10. What if I don’t reply to a tolled message?
If you don’t reply, the sender can reclaim the unused 50% after 7 days.

### 11. What if I never read the message?
If you ignore it completely for 7 days, the sender gets a full refund.

### 12. How does reclaiming the toll work?
After 7 days of no reply or no read, the sender just needs to reopen the chat, and the refund happens automatically.

### 13. What do the Toll colors under the message bar mean?
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟩 Green | No toll required (Friend or Connection) |
| ⚫ Black | Toll required (You are Tolled) |
| 🔴 Red | You are Blocked — cannot message |

### 14. What are the different contact statuses and how do they affect tolls?
| Status | Toll Required? | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Friend 🟢 | ❌ No | Open messaging + profile sharing |
| Connection 🔵 | ❌ No | Trusted contact, limited sharing |
| Tolled ⚫ | ✅ Yes | Must pay toll to message |
| Blocked 🔴 | 🚫 No | Cannot message you |

### 15. How do I change someone’s status (Friend, Connection, etc.)?
Open their chat → Tap profile icon (👤) → Select a new status → Update

### 16. What happens if LIB price changes?
The toll you set in USD is always converted to LIB automatically at the current market rate when someone sends the message.

### 17. Do I get the toll instantly when they send the message?
No. You only receive the toll after reading (50%) and after replying (remaining 50%).

### 18. Why is part of the toll released only when I reply?
This prevents people from “farming” tolls without engaging. It rewards real communication, not passive message reading.

### 19. What happens if someone blocks me? Will I still pay a toll?
No. If someone has set you as Blocked, you cannot send messages at all.

### 20. What’s the point of setting a high toll?
To control your attention, reduce noise, or monetize valuable incoming messages (e.g., if you're an influencer or receive high volumes of requests).
