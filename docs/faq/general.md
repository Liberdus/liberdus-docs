# ❓ General

### 1. What is Liberdus?

Liberdus is a decentralized messaging and payments platform that allows users to send quantum encrypted messages and transact without intermediaries. Liberdus is built using a the Shardus framework which creates application specific decentralized technologies. These “chains” or “distrusted ledger technologies” provide the ability to scale the platform as the user base grows and also enhance security and censorship resistance, whilst simultaneously enabling users to set message tolls to manage spam and monetize interactions.

### 2. How does Liberdus compare to Session, Signal, Telegram, and WhatsApp?

Unlike traditional messaging apps, Liberdus is designed as a Web3-first platform, integrating decentralized messaging and payments without relying on centralized servers. For in depth comparison between Liberdus and other networks, please see the comparison page on the Liberdus website.

### 3. What makes Liberdus different from other messaging apps?

- Decentralization: No central servers store messages; transactions and interactions are validated by the network.
- Integrated Payments: Users can send and receive cryptocurrency payments alongside messages.
- Toll System for Messages: Users can charge a small fee to receive messages, reducing spam and unwanted contact.
- Censorship Resistance: There is no single entity that can shut down or control the network.
