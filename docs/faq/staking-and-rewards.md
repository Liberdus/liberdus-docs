# 💰 Staking & Rewards

### 1. What is staking?

Staking is the process of locking LIB tokens to support network security and operations. In return, participants earn staking rewards.

### 2. How do I stake LIB?

Users can stake LIB through the Liberdus app. See the Liberdus staking tutorial for more.

### 3. How do I unstake LIB?

Users can stake LIB through the Liberdus app. See the Liberdus unstaking tutorial for more.

### 4. Do I need to claim my rewards or are they claimed automatically?

Rewards need to be claimed manually and are not claimed automatically or autocompounded.
Rewards can only be claimed after rotation, as validators enter a cooldown period of approximately 2–3 cycles. During cooldown, the stake remains locked for network security. Once the cooldown completes, validators can withdraw both their stake and any pending rewards.

### 5. How much can I earn by staking?

Staking rewards depend on multiple factors, including network activity and token issuance schedules. A specific APY (Annual Percentage Yield) will be determined based on network conditions.
