# Liquidity Pools

## What Are Liquidity Pools?

A **liquidity pool** is a smart contract on a decentralized exchange (DEX) that holds two tokens in equal USD value.  
When you trade one token for another (e.g., **LIB → DAI**), the pool automatically adjusts their ratios using an **automated market maker (AMM)** formula, keeping the market balanced.  

Each pool has its own **trading pair**, such as `LIB / DAI`, `LIB / wETH`

Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit both tokens into these pools and earn a proportional share of trading fees whenever swaps occur.

## Why LIB Needs Liquidity Pools

Liquidity pools are essential for LIB’s usability and price stability. They allow anyone to buy, sell, or swap LIB without relying on centralized intermediaries or order books.  

By providing liquidity, users:

- Ensure **smooth trading** and tighter spreads in a decentralized way
- Support **price discovery** across exchanges  
- Enable **instant token swaps** without counterparties
- Earn **a share of Uniswap trading fees** as liquidity providers  

Simply put: liquidity pools give LIB its real-world liquidity and accessibility.

## Why DEXs Are Important

**Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** like [**Uniswap**](https://app.uniswap.org/) are the foundation of open, permissionless finance.  
Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs), they:

- Allow **anyone** to trade directly from their wallet  
- Require **no KYC, sign-up, or custody of funds**  
- Are governed by **smart contracts**, not companies  
- Provide **transparency**, since all trades occur on-chain  

For Liberdus, DEXs ensure that users remain in full control of their LIB tokens in line with the project’s mission of privacy, decentralization, and user sovereignty.
