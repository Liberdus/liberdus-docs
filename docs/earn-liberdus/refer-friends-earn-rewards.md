# Refer Friends & Earn Rewards

Liberdus may offer referral rewards to recognize users who help introduce new participants to the network. The referral system is designed to encourage genuine adoption while protecting the integrity and decentralization of the ecosystem.

## Overview

Referral rewards are intended to support organic growth by rewarding users who invite others to join and actively use Liberdus. Rather than incentivizing mass sign-ups, the focus is on meaningful participation and long-term engagement.

Specific reward structures, eligibility criteria and limits may evolve over time as the network matures.

## Eligibility & Verification

To qualify for referral rewards, referred users must meet verification requirements designed to prevent abuse and ensure fairness. Although the specific requirements are yet to be determined.


## Rewards

Eligible referrals may result in **LIB rewards** for the referring user. Reward amounts, timing and distribution methods may vary and are subject to change.

Rewards may be:
- Distributed progressively rather than immediately  
- Adjusted based on network conditions  
- Limited to prevent exploitation or manipulation  

This approach helps align incentives with the long-term health of the Liberdus ecosystem.

## Responsible Use

Referral systems are intended to reward genuine advocacy, not spam or misleading promotion. Users are expected to:
- Share accurate information about Liberdus  
- Avoid deceptive or aggressive referral practices  
- Respect user privacy and consent  

Liberdus reserves the right to withhold or revoke referral rewards in cases of abuse.
