# Provide Liquidity & Earn Yield

## Liberdus LP Farming & Staking Guide

Liberdus allows users to earn **LIB rewards** by providing liquidity to supported trading pairs and staking their **Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens** in the Liberdus farming contracts. This process is commonly referred to as **liquidity farming** or **LP staking**.

---

## What Are Liquidity Pools?

A **liquidity pool** is a smart contract on a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as Uniswap that holds two tokens in equal USD value.

**Examples:**
- LIB / DAI  
- LIB / WETH  

When users trade between tokens (e.g. LIB → DAI), the pool automatically adjusts token balances using an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** formula. This enables continuous trading without relying on buyers and sellers matching orders directly.

---

## Why Liquidity Pools Matter for LIB

Liquidity pools are essential for LIB’s usability and decentralization. They:

- Enable permissionless buying, selling, and swapping of LIB  
- Support fair price discovery  
- Allow instant swaps without intermediaries  
- Reduce reliance on centralized exchanges  
- Generate trading fees for liquidity providers  

By contributing liquidity, users help ensure LIB remains liquid, accessible, and efficiently tradable.

## Overview & Connecting to the Farming Page

Once signed in to the Liberdus test page:

1. Click the **menu icon** (three lines) in the top-right corner  
2. Select **Farm** to open the LP Farming page  
3. Connect your wallet (e.g. MetaMask) if not already connected  
4. Enter your MetaMask password and click **Connect**

The farming page displays available liquidity pairs, such as:

- LIB / DAI (Uniswap V2)  
- LIB / WETH (Uniswap V2)

For each pair, you will see:

- **APR** (Annual Percentage Rate)  
- **Pool Weight**  
- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**  
- **My Share** (your share of the pool)  
- **My Reward** (earned LIB rewards)

Clicking either:
- The blue **My Share** button, or  
- The overall pair panel  

will open the **Staking Portal** for that liquidity pool.

---

## Step 1: Providing Liquidity (Prerequisite)

Before staking, you must provide liquidity on **Uniswap V2** for the chosen pair (e.g. LIB/DAI or LIB/WETH).

When you add liquidity:

- You deposit both tokens in equal USD value  
- You receive **LP tokens** representing your share of the pool  

These LP tokens are what you stake in the Liberdus farming system.

---

## Step 2: Staking LP Tokens

Once LP tokens are available in your wallet:

1. Open the **Staking Portal** for your chosen pair  
2. Select the **Stake** tab (if not already selected)

The staking interface displays:

- Available LP Tokens  
- Amount to Stake  
- A slider with preset options:  
  - 0%  
  - 25%  
  - 50%  
  - 75%  
  - MAX  
- Estimated APR  

3. Enter the amount of LP tokens to stake using the input field or slider  
4. Click **Stake LP Tokens**  
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet  

After confirmation:

- Your LP tokens are locked in the farming contract (with **no lock-up or forced unstaking period**)  
- You begin earning **LIB rewards automatically**

---

## Step 3: Viewing Your Staked Position

Once LP tokens are staked, the portal shows:

- **Pending Rewards (LIB)**  
- **Staked LP Tokens**  
- **Current APR**

Rewards accrue continuously while your LP tokens remain staked.

---

## Step 4: Claiming Rewards

To claim earned LIB rewards:

1. Open the **Claim** tab in the staking portal  
2. Review:
   - Pending Rewards  
   - Staked Amount  
   - Current APR  
3. Click **Claim Rewards**  
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet  

Claiming rewards:

- Transfers earned LIB to your wallet  
- Does **not** unstake your LP tokens  
- Allows farming to continue uninterrupted  

---

## Step 5: Unstaking LP Tokens

To remove LP tokens from farming:

1. Open the **Unstake** tab  
2. Enter the amount to unstake using the input field or slider  
3. Review:
   - Staked LP Tokens  
   - Pending Rewards  

You will also see a **“Claim reward tokens”** checkbox:

- When enabled, any unclaimed LIB rewards are claimed during unstaking  

4. Click **Unstake LP Tokens**  
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet  

After unstaking:

- LP tokens are returned to your wallet  
- Farming rewards stop for the unstaked amount  
- You may optionally remove liquidity from Uniswap to reclaim the underlying tokens  

---

## Summary

Liberdus LP Farming allows users to:

- Provide liquidity for LIB trading pairs  
- Stake LP tokens to earn LIB rewards  
- Claim rewards independently or during unstaking  
- Support decentralized liquidity and price stability for the LIB ecosystem  

All interactions are executed via smart contracts and require wallet confirmation for transparency and security.
