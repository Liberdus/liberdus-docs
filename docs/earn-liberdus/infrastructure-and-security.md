# Infrastructure & Security

Reliable infrastructure and secure operations are critical to running a Liberdus validator.

## Hardware & Infrastructure Requirements

Refer to the specifications provided in the official repository: https://github.com/Liberdus/validator-dashboard

## Validator Performance & Monitoring

- Maintain redundant network links and backup power to ensure high uptime.
- Monitor node health, latency, and logs continuously.
- Automated alerts for downtime or errors help prevent accidental slashing.

## Slashing & Risk Management

- Validators can be **slashed** for:
  - Double signing or equivocation
  - Extended downtime
  - Violating protocol rules
- Protective measures exist to reduce accidental slashing.
- Repeated performance failures can lead to removal from the validator set.
- The network penalizes behaviour even if it temporarily unavailable.
