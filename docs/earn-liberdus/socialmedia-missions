# Complete Social Media Missions

Social Media Missions allow users to earn rewards by supporting Liberdus across key public channels. These missions are designed to grow awareness responsibly while aligning incentives with long-term participation rather than short-term extraction.

## Overview

Social Media Missions reward users for completing specific actions such as following Liberdus accounts, reposting official announcements and joining community channels. Each mission carries a weighted value based on its impact, with a bonus awarded for completing all available missions.

Rather than issuing large one-time payouts, rewards are distributed gradually to encourage genuine engagement and long-term alignment with the ecosystem.

## Mission Structure

Each mission contributes a weighted score toward a user’s total reward:

- Follow Liberdus on X and repost an official message **(+3)**
- Follow Liberdus on CoinMarketCap **(+1)**
- Join the Liberdus Discord **(+2)**
- Follow Liberdus on LinkedIn **(+2)**
- Subscribe to Liberdus on YouTube **(+1)**
- Subscribe to Liberdus on Substack **(+1)**

**Completion Bonus**
- Complete all listed missions **(+5)**

Mission weights may be adjusted over time to reflect impact and platform relevance.


## Message Requirements

Where reposting or sharing is required, users must:
- Use the official Liberdus link or announcement provided in-app
- Avoid altering or misrepresenting the message
- Refrain from misleading claims or promotional exaggeration

Submissions that violate these guidelines may be excluded from rewards.

## Using Earned LIB

Users are encouraged to actively participate in the Liberdus economy with earned LIB, including:
- Adding liquidity to supported trading pairs
- Earning yield through liquidity provision
- Holding LIB to support network stability

Social Media Missions are designed not only to reward visibility, but to onboard users into meaningful participation within the Liberdus ecosystem.

Mission availability, weights and rewards may evolve over time as the network matures.
