# Contribute Code & Earn

Liberdus is built as an open, decentralized protocol where independent contributors play a critical role in improving security, reliability and long-term sustainability. Community developers are encouraged to contribute code, review changes and identify vulnerabilities, and are compensated for meaningful contributions.

## Overview

Liberdus welcomes contributions from decentralized developers, auditors and researchers who wish to help strengthen the protocol. Rather than relying on a closed development model, Liberdus embraces open collaboration to reduce single points of failure and increase resilience.

Contributions may include new features, security improvements, performance optimizations, testing, documentation, or formal code reviews. All accepted contributions are evaluated on merit and impact, not affiliation.

> Bounties and contribution programs will expand progressively after mainnet as the protocol and tooling mature.

## Why Decentralized Contributions Matter

Decentralized development is essential to Liberdus’s security model. A diverse contributor base helps ensure that:
- Vulnerabilities are identified earlier  
- Code is reviewed from multiple independent perspectives  
- No single entity controls protocol evolution  
- Long-term maintenance remains sustainable  

This approach aligns with Liberdus’s commitment to censorship resistance, trust minimization and user sovereignty.

## Contribution Areas

Contributors may assist across a range of areas, including:
- Core protocol development  
- Smart contract improvements and audits  
- Backend and infrastructure tooling  
- Client applications and UX improvements  
- Testing, fuzzing and security analysis  
- Documentation and technical specifications  

Clear contribution guidelines and issue scopes will be published alongside each bounty.

## Rewards & Compensation

Eligible contributions may be rewarded through:
- **LIB token bounties** for completed tasks  
- Compensation for verified security findings  
- Ongoing rewards for high-impact or sustained contributions  

Rewards are issued based on technical quality, relevance and real-world impact rather than volume of submissions.

## Core Principles

All contributors are expected to align with Liberdus’s core principles:
- **Security** — prioritizing safety, correctness and robustness  
- **Transparency** — clear, reviewable and well-documented changes  
- **Decentralization** — avoiding unnecessary central dependencies  
- **Integrity** — responsible disclosure and ethical conduct  

These principles ensure that contributions strengthen Liberdus without compromising its values.
