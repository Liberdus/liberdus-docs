# Account Migration, Locking & Removal

## How to Migrate Accounts

If you have existing Liberdus accounts from older versions or different network builds, you can migrate them into the latest version of the app using the built-in migration tool.

### Steps: Migrating Accounts

1. From the main menu, tap **Menu → Migrate**.
2. You’ll see a list of **Unregistered Accounts** - these are accounts detected on your device but not yet registered on the current network.  
3. Select one or more accounts you want to migrate by ticking the checkboxes.  
4. Scroll down to review the following sections:
   - **Unregistered Accounts:** accounts that can be migrated into the new network.  
   - **Taken (Already Registered):** accounts that already exist on the network (you cannot re-migrate these).
5. Once you’ve selected the correct accounts, tap **Migrate Accounts**.  
6. Wait a few moments - the app will register and import your selected accounts into the new version.  
7. Once complete, your migrated accounts will now appear under your **main dashboard**. You can switch between them normally once migration completes.

## How to Lock Liberdus

Add a lock screen that requires a password for users to authenticate before accessing Liberdus or signing into any accounts.

### Steps
1. Go to **Menu**.  
2. Click **Lock**.  
3. Input your password in the **Password** box and re-enter the same password in the **Confirm Password** box.  
4. Click **Save Password**.  
5. Wait a few seconds - a notification will appear saying **Password Updated**.  

Liberdus will now require your password whenever it’s opened.

### Notes
- Locking is useful for **privacy in shared environments** or on public devices.  
- Make sure your password is memorable, there is no password recovery system.
- You can also lock you account once signed in by clicking on settings -> lock and undertaking the same process as above.

## How to Remove an Account

Delete one or more Liberdus accounts stored on your current device.

### Steps
1. Tap the **Menu** button on the main Liberdus screen.  
2. Select **Remove** from the list of menu options.  
3. You will see the **Remove Accounts** page with two buttons:  
   - **Remove Selected**  
   - **Remove All Accounts**  
4. To remove specific accounts, tap **Remove Selected**.  
5. You’ll be shown a list of your accounts.  
6. Select the ones you want to delete.  
7. Confirm when prompted to proceed.  
8. To delete every account stored on this device, tap **Remove All Accounts**.  
9. Liberdus will ask for confirmation before removing everything.  
10. Once confirmed, all accounts will be **erased from the local device**.

### Important
- Removing accounts does **not delete them from the network**, only from your local device.  
- Always **back up before removing** any account - once deleted locally, recovery is only possible using a valid backup file.  
- If you have multiple accounts, **double-check** which one you are deleting before confirming.
