### 📌 Notes

| Detail | Explanation |
|---------|--------------|
| **Shows LIB + USD** | LIB is your actual balance; USD is a visual conversion for clarity. |
| **Live conversion** | The USD figure is based on the current market rate and may fluctuate. |
| **Future assets** | The Wallet tab may support additional assets later, each listed under “Assets.” |
| **Total Balance** | If multiple assets are supported in the future, Total Balance will show the combined USD value of all assets. |

## 📜 How to View Your Wallet History & Understand Transaction Types

**Purpose:**

---

### ✏️ Steps: Viewing Transaction History
1. Tap the **Wallet** tab.  
2. Tap **History**.  
3. If needed, choose the asset (e.g., **Liberdus (LIB)**) from the dropdown.  
4. Browse the list to see all **Sent**, **Received**, and **Deleted** transactions.

### 📌 Transaction Types & What They Mean

| Type | Color / Label | Meaning |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Sent** | 🔴 Sent (red) | You sent LIB to another user. Displays amount, recipient, memo, and timestamp. |
| **Received** | 🟢 Received (green) | You received LIB from another user. Displays amount, sender, memo, and timestamp. |
| **Deleted** | ⚪ Deleted | You removed the entry locally; the actual blockchain transfer still occurred. |

---

### 🔍 Extra Behaviors (Important)

| Action | Result |
|--------|---------|
| **Tap a Sent or Received transaction** | Opens the chat with that user, showing the message or payment context. |
| **Tap a Deleted transaction** | Nothing happens — deleted entries cannot be opened. |
| **View Memos** | Any memo attached to the transaction (e.g., “dxsx”) appears beneath the entry in history. |

---

### 📝 Notes
- **Deleting** a transaction from history does **not reverse** the transfer — it only removes it locally.  
- The list is sorted from **most recent to oldest**.  
- Future asset support may allow switching between histories using a dropdown menu.  
- **Memos** help you remember the purpose of each transaction.
