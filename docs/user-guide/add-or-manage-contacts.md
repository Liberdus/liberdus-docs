# Add or Manage Contacts

## How to Add or Manage Contacts

Save frequently messaged users to your Contacts list and manage their relationship settings (**Friend**, **Connection**, **Tolled**, or **Blocked**).

### Steps: Adding a Contact

1. Open a **chat** with the user you want to add.  
2. Tap the **profile icon (👤)** in the top-right corner of the chat.  
3. Choose a **relationship status:**
   - **Friend:** Open communication; shares full profile info.  
   - **Connection:** Trusted contact with no toll required.  
   - **Tolled:** Sender must pay to message.  
   - **Blocked:** Cannot message you.
4. Tap **Update** to save the contact.  

The user is now saved in your **Contacts list** and will appear under the **Contacts tab** for quick access.

### Steps: Managing an Existing Contact

1. Go to the **Contacts tab**.  
2. Select the contact you want to manage.  
3. Tap the **profile icon (👤)**.  
4. Change their status to **Friend**, **Connection**, **Tolled**, or **Blocked**.  
5. Tap **Update** to apply the change.

### Important

- Changing a contact’s status updates how **tolls and messaging rules** apply between you.  
- Removing a contact does **not delete past messages**; it only removes them from your saved list.  
- Status changes take effect **immediately**.

## How to Block or Unblock Someone

Prevent a user from messaging you or restore communication if you change your mind.

### Steps: Blocking a User

1. Open the **chat** with the user you want to block.  
2. Tap the **profile icon (👤)** in the top-right corner.  
3. Select **Blocked** from the Friend Status options.  
4. Tap **Update** to confirm.  

The blocked user will not be able to send you messages and will see your profile as **unavailable**.

### Steps: Unblocking a User

1. Return to the same user’s chat *(or find them in Contacts)*.  
2. Tap the **profile icon (👤)**.  
3. Change their status to **Tolled**, **Connection**, or **Friend**.  
4. Tap **Update** to save.  

Messaging is restored based on the status you selected.

### Important

- Blocking a user does **not delete chat history** - it only stops future messages.  
- Blocked users **cannot bypass tolls or message restrictions**.  
- Blocking is **instant, silent, and reversible** - you remain in control.

## How to Change a Contact’s Name

Update or personalize how a contact appears in your Liberdus contact list and chats.

### Steps: Editing a Contact’s Name

1. Open the **chat** with the contact whose name you want to change.  
2. Tap their **profile icon (👤)** in the top-right corner to open **Contact Info**.  
3. Tap the **edit icon** next to the **Name** field.  
4. Enter a new **display name** of your choice.  
5. Tap **Save** (or confirm your entry).  

The new name will immediately appear in your **chat list**, **contact info**, and **message view**.

### Important

| Detail | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Local name only** | Changing a contact’s name only affects how *you* see them. It doesn’t change how they appear on their own device or for others. |
| **Optional field** | You can leave the name blank, in this case, Liberdus will display **“Not Entered.”** |
| **Username remains constant** | The unique Liberdus username (e.g., `crl`) and public key always stay the same, even if you rename the contact. |
| **Revert easily** | You can tap again to edit or clear the name anytime. |
