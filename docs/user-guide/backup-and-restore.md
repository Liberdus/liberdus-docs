# 🗄️ Backup & Restore

Liberdus allows you to back up and restore your account data across devices and platforms. Backups are encrypted and portable, enabling secure migration without losing messages, keys, or settings.

A backup file contains your Liberdus account data, including keys, contacts, and preferences.
You can use this file to restore your account on another device or browser instance.

> Note: The backup file is encrypted. Keep it safe and do not share it with anyone.
