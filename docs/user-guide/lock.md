# Lock

This guide will walk you through the process of locking your Liberdus account with a password. Locking your account adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that only you can access it after signing out.

## Why Lock Your Account?

- Security: A password protects all your accounts when you sign out.
- Access Control: You’ll need the password to unlock and use your account again.

> **Important Note:** If you lose your password, you will not be able to recover access to your accounts. Make sure to store it in a safe place.

## Steps to Lock Your Account

- Go to Settings → Lock
- Enter your password & click on "Save Password" button.

After locking, sign out of the app. The next time you log in, you’ll need to enter the password to unlock.

## What to Do If You Forget Your Password

Unfortunately, there is no way to recover a lost password. To avoid losing access:
Back up your account details (e.g., recovery phrase) before locking.
