## 🤙 How to Make a Voice Call

Start a live voice call with another Liberdus user. Liberdus uses **Jitsi** to deliver private, encrypted, peer-to-peer audio and video calls.

### Steps: Starting a Voice Call (Call Now)

1. Open the **chat** with the person you want to call.  
2. Tap the **Call icon (📞)** at the top of the chat.  
3. A popup will appear - choose **Call Now**.  
4. Liberdus will launch a **Jitsi call window** (browser or terminal depending on your system).  
5. If this is your first call, your browser or system will ask for **microphone and/or camera permissions**.  
   - Click **Allow**.  
6. *(Optional)* Choose your preferred mic or camera from the dropdown.  
7. Tap **Join** in the Jitsi window to begin the call.  
8. Wait for the other user to join. Once connected, you can speak normally.  

You are now on a live **voice/video call** with your contact through Jitsi.

### Important

- **Microphone permission** is required - callers will not hear you otherwise.  
- Calls are **not routed through Liberdus servers**; Jitsi handles the encrypted media stream.  
- If the other user declines or doesn’t answer, simply close the Jitsi window or try again later.

## 📅 How to Schedule a Call

Plan a future call with one or more Liberdus users. Scheduled calls let you set a time, notify participants, and optionally invite additional contacts to the same call event.

### Steps: Scheduling a Call

1. Open the **chat** with the user you want to schedule a call with.  
2. Tap the **Call icon (📞)** at the top of the screen.  
3. Select **Schedule** from the popup menu.  
4. Choose the **date and time** for the call.  
5. Tap **Submit** to schedule.  

A scheduled call message will appear in the chat, showing the call time along with a **Join Call** button once the scheduled time arrives.

### Adding Additional Participants (Optional)

1. After the call is scheduled, click the **scheduled call message**.  
2. Tap **Invite** from the pop-up menu.  
3. Select any of your **Connections** to add to the call *(maximum: 10 participants)*.  
4. Tap **Invite** to confirm.  

The selected users are added to the scheduled call and will receive a call notification.

### Important Rules About Invites

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|--------------|
| **You cannot invite someone who has blocked you** | If you try, Liberdus will display an error (e.g., “You cannot invite ___ (you are blocked)”). |
| **Only your connections can be invited** | You cannot schedule a call with random users- they must have added you as a friend. |
| **Max group size: 10 participants** | This includes the original recipient. |
| **Invites are silent for blocked users** | A blocked user will not receive an invite under any circumstance. |

### Important & Behaviors

- All participants must **manually join** the call when the time comes- nobody is auto-entered into the Jitsi room.  
- **Jitsi** handles the live call and will ask for **permissions** if video or mic access is needed.  
- Scheduled calls support **voice or video** depending on what you enable when joining Jitsi.  
- To change a time, simply **delete the scheduled call message** and create a new one (editing is not supported).

## 📞 How to Join a Call or Scheduled Call (as a Participant)

Join a live call someone else has started or scheduled in Liberdus. Calls use **Jitsi**, so you may be asked for **microphone and camera permissions** when joining.

### Joining a “Call Now” (Instant Call)

1. Open the **chat** where the call is happening.  
2. When the call has started, a **Join Call** banner or message will appear.  
3. Tap **Join Call**.  
4. Liberdus will open the **Jitsi call window**.  
5. If prompted, allow **microphone** (and **camera** for video calls).  
6. Tap **Join** in Jitsi to enter the call.  

You are now connected and can speak with the other participant(s).

### Joining a Scheduled Call

1. A **scheduled call message** will appear with the date and time of the call.  
2. The scheduled call message can be found in the **original chat** and under the **Calls section in Settings**.  
   - If there are no calls, it will display: *“No Scheduled Calls.”*  
3. Tap **Join Call**.  
4. The **Jitsi** window will launch.  
5. Allow permissions if prompted (mic/camera).  
6. Tap **Join** to enter the call.  

You are now in the scheduled call with the host and any other invited participants.

### Important

| Behavior | Explanation |
|-----------|--------------|
| **You must join manually** | Liberdus will not auto-join you into a call. |
| **If you are blocked, you cannot join** | You will not be invited, notified, or allowed to enter a scheduled call from someone who has blocked you. |
| **Permissions matter** | You must allow **microphone** (and **camera**) access for others to hear or see you. |
| **Join link is unique per call** | You must join from the **call message inside the chat**, not from another conversation. |

   - If you haven’t scheduled any yet, it will say **“No Scheduled Calls.”**

### Important

| Feature | Description |

| **Centralized access** | All scheduled calls- whether created by you or someone else- appear in this list. |

## Tips

- To create a new call, go to a chat and use the **📞 Call icon → Schedule** option.  
- If a participant **blocks you**, your invite to that call will **not send**.  
- After joining or finishing a call, the scheduled entry will **automatically disappear** once its time has passed.
