# How to Bridge LIB Assets between Networks

The Bridge feature lets you move LIB tokens between Liberdus and external networks (e.g., Polygon, Ethereum, etc., depending on what the network supports). You choose the direction, complete the steps, and the bridge handles the transfer.

## Where to Find the Bridge

1. Sign in to your Liberdus account.
2. Tap the ☰ menu icon (top-right).
3. Select Bridge from the menu list.

You will now see the Bridge screen.

**Step 1: Choose the Bridge Direction**

1. You will see a dropdown labelled Bridge Direction.
 Select one of the following:
    - From External Network to Liberdus
        Use this when depositing LIB into your Liberdus wallet.
    - From Liberdus to External Network
        Use this when withdrawing LIB to an outside network.
2. Tap Continue
3. You will then be directed to the Liberdus Token Bridge
4. Connect you wallet and ensure its connected to the right network

**Step 2: Follow the On-Screen Instructions**

Depending on the direction you selected, the app will ask you to:

**A) If sending LIB to Liberdus (deposit):**
You will be shown:
- The network you must send from
- A destination LIB address (your Liberdus wallet)
- Amount
- A reminder of any required minimums or fees
You then complete the transaction using your external wallet (MetaMask, etc.).

**B) If sending LIB from Liberdus (withdraw):**
You will be asked to:
- Enter the external wallet address
- Enter the amount
- Review the transaction fee
- Confirm the transfer

You will then proceed to the confirmation screen and send the transaction.

## Important Notes

- Transaction typically completes in 2-5 minutes. But bridges may take some time additional to process depending on the external network.
- Always double-check the destination address: bridged transactions cannot be reversed.
- If an external wallet requires a specific network (Polygon, Ethereum, etc.), make sure you are connected to the correct one.
- If a network is unavailable, the bridge will not allow the transfer direction.
