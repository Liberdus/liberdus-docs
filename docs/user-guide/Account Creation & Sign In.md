### 📌 Notes

| Detail | Explanation |
|--------|--------------|
| **Local sign-out only** | Signing out removes your active session on this device but does **not** delete your account or messages. |
| **Backup first** | If you haven’t saved your account backup, do this before signing out to prevent loss of access. |
| **Return to login screen** | After signing out, you’ll see the main Liberdus splash screen with options to **Sign In**, **Create Account**, or **Open Menu**. |
| **Re-signing in** | You can sign back in anytime using your existing account credentials or backup file. |

### 🧠 Tip
If you plan to use Liberdus on another device, export your backup first from  
**Settings → Backup → Download Backup File**,  
then import it on the new device during **Sign In**.
