# Wallet Balance & History

## How to View Your LIB Wallet Balance

Check how much **LIB** you currently own, along with its estimated value in **USD**.

### Steps: Viewing Your Balance

1. Tap the **Wallet** tab at the bottom of the screen.  
2. At the top, you will see your **Total Balance**, shown in **USD**.  
3. Under **Assets**, find **Liberdus (LIB)**.  
4. Your **LIB amount** is displayed on the right, while the **USD equivalent** appears underneath it.  

You can instantly see your LIB holdings and their approximate USD market value.

### Important

| Detail | Explanation |
|---------|--------------|
| **Shows LIB + USD** | LIB is your actual balance; USD is a visual conversion for clarity. |
| **Live conversion** | The USD figure is based on the current market rate and may fluctuate. |
| **Future assets** | The Wallet tab may support additional assets later, each listed under “Assets.” |
| **Total Balance** | If multiple assets are supported in the future, Total Balance will show the combined USD value of all assets. |

## How to View Your Wallet History & Understand Transaction Types

Review all past wallet transactions including **Sent**, **Received**, and **Deleted** records- and quickly jump back to the related chat when needed.

### Steps: Viewing Transaction History

1. Tap the **Wallet** tab.  
2. Tap **History**.  
3. If needed, choose the asset (e.g., **Liberdus (LIB)**) from the dropdown.  
4. Browse the list to see all **Sent**, **Received**, and **Deleted** transactions.  

### Transaction Types & What They Mean

| Type | Label | Description |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Sent** | 🔴 Sent (red)          | You sent LIB to another user. Displays amount, recipient, memo, and timestamp. |
| **Received** | 🟢 Received (green) | You received LIB from another user. Displays amount, sender, memo, and timestamp. |
| **Deleted** | ⚪ Deleted            | You removed the entry locally; the actual blockchain transfer still occurred. |

### Notes and Behaviors

| Action | Result |
|--------|---------|
| **Tap a Sent or Received transaction** | Opens the chat with that user, showing the message or payment context. |
| **Tap a Deleted transaction** | Nothing happens- deleted entries cannot be opened. |
| **View Memos** | Any memo attached to the transaction (e.g., “dxsx”) appears beneath the entry in history. |

### Important

- **Deleting** a transaction from history does **not reverse** the transfer- it only removes it locally.  
- The list is sorted from **most recent to oldest**.  
- Future asset support may allow switching between histories using a dropdown menu.  
- **Memos** help you remember the purpose of each transaction.
