# Voice Messaging

## How to Send A Voice Message

### Steps: Sending a Voice Message

1. Open a **chat** with the user you want to message.  
2. Tap the **microphone icon** next to the message input bar.  
3. When the **Voice Message** window appears, tap **Start Recording**.  
4. Speak into your microphone - the timer will display your recording length.  
5. When finished, tap **Stop**.  
6. You will now see three options:  
   - **Listen:** Play back your recording before sending.  
   - **Send:** Deliver the voice message to the recipient.  
   - **Cancel:** Discard the recording.  
7. Tap **Send** to deliver the voice message.

The voice message will appear in the chat and can be played by the recipient once processed by the network.

## Listening to a Received Voice Message

1. Tap the **play button** on the voice message bubble.  
2. Use the playback controls to:  
   - **Play / Pause**  
   - **Drag the timeline**  
   - **Adjust speed** (1x, etc.)

### Important

- You must **allow microphone permissions** for recording to work.  
- Voice messages send just like normal text messages and may still require a **toll** if applicable.  
- You can **listen before sending** - the message isn’t delivered until you tap **Send**.
