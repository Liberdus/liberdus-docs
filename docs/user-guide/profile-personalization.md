## 🌟 How to Edit Your Profile or Personal Info

Customize your public **Liberdus profile** including your display name, contact details, and linked social accounts so your friends can recognize and connect with you easily.

### Method 1: Editing from *My Info*

1. From the main screen, tap your **Profile icon** (top-right corner).  
2. Tap the **✏️ edit icon** at the top of your *My Info* page.  
3. You’ll be taken to the **My Profile** screen.  
4. Enter or update your information:  
   - **Name:** How others see you.  
   - **Email (optional):** Shared with contacts.  
   - **Phone (optional).**  
   - **LinkedIn username.**  
   - **X (Twitter) username.**  
5. Tap **Update Profile** to save your changes.  

Your updated information will now appear in your *My Info* card- including your display name and **unique QR code** for sharing your contact easily.

### Method 2: Editing from *Settings*

1. Tap the **⚙️ Settings** icon on the main screen.  
2. Select **Profile** from the menu.

## Important

| Detail | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Shared info** | Profile details are visible to your **connections**; only the information you choose to enter is displayed. |
| **Unique ID & QR** | Your **public key** and **QR code** always stay the same, even if you update other details. |
| **Optional fields** | Email, phone, and social media links are **optional**- leaving them blank hides them from your contacts. |
| **Two access points** | You can edit via **My Info → ✏️** or **Settings → Profile**- both update the same data. |
