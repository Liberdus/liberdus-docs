# 📇 Contacts, Friendship Types, Blocking & Unblocking

## 📇 How to Add or Manage Contacts

**Purpose:**  
Save frequently messaged users to your Contacts list and manage their relationship settings  
(**Friend**, **Connection**, **Tolled**, or **Blocked**).

---

### ✏️ Steps: Adding a Contact
1. Open a **chat** with the user you want to add.  
2. Tap the **profile icon (👤)** in the top-right corner of the chat.  
3. Choose a **relationship status:**

   - **Friend:** Open communication; shares full profile info.  
   - **Connection:** Trusted contact with no toll required.  
   - **Tolled:** Sender must pay to message.  
   - **Blocked:** Cannot message you.

4. Tap **Update** to save the contact.  

**✅ Result:**  
The user is now saved in your **Contacts list** and will appear under the **Contacts tab** for quick access.

---

### ✏️ Steps: Managing an Existing Contact
1. Go to the **Contacts tab**.  
2. Select the contact you want to manage.  
3. Tap the **profile icon (👤)**.  
4. Change their status to **Friend**, **Connection**, **Tolled**, or **Blocked**.  
5. Tap **Update** to apply the change.

---

### 📌 Notes
- Changing a contact’s status updates how **tolls and messaging rules** apply between you.  
- Removing a contact does **not delete past messages**; it only removes them from your saved list.  
- Status changes take effect **immediately**.

## 🚫 How to Block or Unblock Someone

**Purpose:**  
Prevent a user from messaging you — or restore communication if you change your mind.

---

### ✏️ Steps: Blocking a User
1. Open the **chat** with the user you want to block.  
2. Tap the **profile icon (👤)** in the top-right corner.  
3. Select **Blocked** from the Friend Status options.  
4. Tap **Update** to confirm.  

**✅ Result:**  
The blocked user will not be able to send you messages and will see your profile as **unavailable**.

---

### ✏️ Steps: Unblocking a User
1. Return to the same user’s chat *(or find them in Contacts)*.  
2. Tap the **profile icon (👤)**.  
3. Change their status to **Tolled**, **Connection**, or **Friend**.  
4. Tap **Update** to save.  

**✅ Result:**  
Messaging is restored based on the status you selected.

---

### 📌 Notes
- Blocking a user does **not delete chat history** — it only stops future messages.  
- Blocked users **cannot bypass tolls or message restrictions**.  
- Blocking is **instant, silent, and reversible** — you remain in control.

### 📌 Notes

| Detail | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Local name only** | Changing a contact’s name only affects how *you* see them. It doesn’t change how they appear on their own device or for others. |
| **Optional field** | You can leave the name blank — in this case, Liberdus will display **“Not Entered.”** |
| **Username remains constant** | The unique Liberdus username (e.g., `crl`) and public key always stay the same, even if you rename the contact. |
| **Revert easily** | You can tap ✏️ again to edit or clear the name anytime. |
