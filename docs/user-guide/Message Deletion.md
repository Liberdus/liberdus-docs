# 🗑️ Message Deletion

## 🗑️Deleting Messages

**Purpose:**  
Remove a message or voice message from a chat — either only on your own device or for both sides of the conversation.

---

## ✏️ Steps: Deleting a Message
1. Click the **message**, **voice message**, **call schedule**, or **file** you want to delete.  
2. A menu will appear with deletion options.  
   - If you clicked **your own message**, you will see:  
     - **Delete for me**  
     - **Delete for all**  
   - If it’s a message **someone else sent you**, you will only see **Delete for me** (you cannot delete the message on their end).  
3. Tap the desired option to **confirm deletion**.

## 🧾 Deletion Options

| Option | What It Does |
|---------|---------------|
| **Delete for me** | Removes the message only from **your own device**. The other person will still see it. |
| **Delete for all** *(your own messages only)* | Removes the message from **both devices**. The recipient will see “Deleted by sender.” |

---

### 📌 Important Notes
- You can only use **Delete for all** on messages **you send**, not those from others.  
- **Delete for all** only works **after** the recipient has received the message.  
- **Voice messages**, **call schedules**, and **files** follow the same deletion rules as text messages.  
- There is **no undo**, so make sure you choose the correct delete option before confirming.
