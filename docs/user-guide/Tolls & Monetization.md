# 💰 Tolls & Monetization

## 💰 How to Change Your Toll Amount

**Purpose:**  
Update the toll amount that other users must pay to send you a message or payment.  
This helps you control spam and manage who can contact you freely.

---

### ✏️ Steps: Changing Your Toll
1. Sign in to your **Liberdus** account.  
2. From the main screen, tap the **⚙️ Settings** icon (top right).  
3. Select **Toll** from the Settings menu.  
4. View your **Current Toll Amount** at the top of the screen.  
5. In the **Set New Toll Amount** section, enter your desired toll in **USD**.  
6. Tap **Save Changes** to apply the update.

---

### 📌 Notes
- Liberdus automatically **converts your toll from USD into LIB** at the current exchange rate.  
- Setting your toll to **0.000000 USD** removes toll requirements and allows open messaging.  
- The **minimum toll is 0.2000 USD** — entering a lower amount will show an error and cannot be saved.  
- The toll only applies to users who **haven’t added you** as a Friend or Connection, or who you have set to **Tolled**.

---

### 💡 Tip
- To prevent all **unsolicited messages**, set a **higher toll**.  
- To allow **open communication**, set your toll to **0 USD**.

2. Open the **chat** with the recipient.  
3. Simply **open and close** the chat window — no action button is required.  
4. Liberdus will automatically **return any unclaimed toll amount** to your wallet.

## 🧾 Rules & Explanations

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|--------------|
| **7-day wait is mandatory** | Reclaiming is only possible after the full 7-day period has passed. |
| **No reply = reclaimable** | If the recipient never replies, you can reclaim 100% of the toll. |
| **Partial reply = partial payout** | If they read or reply, they may earn part of the toll, and only the unused portion is reclaimable. |
| **Reclaim happens automatically** | There is no button — opening and closing the chat triggers the refund logic. |
| **No new messages** | If you send another message before the 7 days are up, the countdown resets. |
