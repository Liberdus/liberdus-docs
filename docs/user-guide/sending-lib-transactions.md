# Sending LIB Transactions

## How to Send LIB (Liberdus Tokens)

Transfer **LIB tokens** securely to another user- either directly from a **chat** or manually via your **wallet**.

### Method 1: Sending LIB Directly from Chat

This is the fastest way when you’re already chatting with someone.

1. Open the **chat** with the person you want to send LIB to.  
2. Tap the **💲** at the top of the screen.  
3. Their **username** will be automatically filled in.  
4. Enter the **amount** you want to send- displayed in **LIB** (and sometimes in **USD**).  
5. *(Optional)* Add a short **memo** (e.g., “hey,” “payment for call,” “thanks”).  
6. Tap **Send**.  
7. Review the **Confirm Transaction** screen- it will display:  
   - **Recipient**  
   - **Amount**  
   - **Asset (Liberdus LIB)**  
   - **Memo**  
8. Tap **Confirm Send** to complete, or **Cancel** if you change your mind.  

The payment will appear instantly in the **chat** as a transaction message (e.g., “+1.000000 LIB”), and the **recipient will be notified**.

### Method 2: Sending LIB via Wallet

Use this method for users **not yet in your chat list**, or when sending directly to a **username** or **QR code**.

1. Tap the **Wallet** tab at the bottom of the screen.  
2. Tap **Send**.  
3. Under **Asset**, make sure **Liberdus (LIB)** is selected.  
4. In the **Recipient** field, choose one of the following:  
   - Enter their **username**, or  
   - Tap the **📷** to scan their QR code, or  
   - Tap the **🖼️** to upload an image containing their QR code.  
5. Enter the **amount** to send.  
   - You’ll see your **available balance** and **network fee** below (e.g., “Available: 37.500000 LIB | Fee: 1.25 LIB”).  
6. *(Optional)* Add a **memo**.  
7. Tap **Send**.  
8. On the **Confirm Transaction** screen, double-check all details.  
9. Tap **Confirm Send** to complete the transfer.  

You’ll see a **success confirmation**, and the transaction will appear in **Wallet → History** as 🔴 **Sent** with your memo and timestamp.
