## 📌 Notes

| Detail | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Shared info** | Profile details are visible to your **connections**; only the information you choose to enter is displayed. |
| **Unique ID & QR** | Your **public key** and **QR code** always stay the same, even if you update other details. |
| **Optional fields** | Email, phone, and social media links are **optional** — leaving them blank hides them from your contacts. |
| **Two access points** | You can edit via **My Info → ✏️** or **Settings → Profile** — both update the same data. |
