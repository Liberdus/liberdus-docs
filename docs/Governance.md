## Decentralized Governance in Liberdus

Governance on **Liberdus** will be fully **on-chain**, empowering token holders to shape the evolution of the network through transparent, democratic decision-making.

The governance framework, known as **LDAO (Liberdus DAO)**, will allow the community to:
- Propose and vote on protocol upgrades  
- Adjust network parameters (such as toll rates, staking rewards, or validator thresholds)  
- Fund ecosystem initiatives and community-driven projects  
- Oversee treasury management and development direction  

LDAO will operate on the principle of **1 LIB = 1 vote**, ensuring that influence scales proportionally with stake while preserving transparency and accountability across all proposals.

💡 **Coming Soon**  
Governance features are currently under development and will be introduced in a future phase of the Liberdus roadmap.
