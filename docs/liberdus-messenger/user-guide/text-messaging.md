Start a conversation with another Liberdus user by searching their username or using their QR code.

### Steps: Sending a New Message

1. Sign in and go to the **Chats** screen.  
2. Tap the **purple + button** in the bottom-right corner.  
3. In the **Recipient** field, choose one of the following methods:
  - Search by Username:
    - Begin typing the recipient’s **Liberdus username**.  
    - When the username is found, tap **Continue**.
  - Upload QR Code:
    - Tap the **image/QR upload icon**.  
    - Select the saved QR image from your device.  
    - Liberdus will automatically detect the user.  
    - Tap **Continue**.
  - Scan QR Code:
    - Tap the **QR scan icon**.  
    - If prompted, allow **camera permissions**.  
    - Scan the user’s QR code and tap **Continue**.
4. You will now be taken into a **new chat window** with that user.  
5. Type your message in the **text box**.  
6. Tap the **send button (purple arrow icon)**.  
7. Wait a few seconds - the message will be delivered once processed by the network.

### Important

- If the recipient has a **toll enabled**, you may be required to **pay** before your first message can be delivered.  
- If the username is **typed incorrectly**, Liberdus will not find a recipient.  
- Once the first message is sent, the chat will remain in your **Chats list** for future conversations.

### Steps: Scanning a QR Code

1. Tap the **purple + button** on the Chats screen to start a new message.  
2. Tap the **QR scan icon** on the “New Chat” screen.  
3. If prompted, allow **camera permissions** so Liberdus can access your camera.

7. Type your message and press **Send**.

### Important

- You can scan from a **printed QR**, another **device**, or a **screen**.  
- If the scan doesn’t detect:  
  - Adjust your distance slightly.  
  - Ensure the QR is **fully visible** and **well-lit**.  
- Scanning a QR only identifies the user; it does **not automatically add them** to Contacts until you assign a status.
