# 💰 Tolls & Monetization

The Toll Settings controls how much another user must pay to send you a message or payment in Liberdus. This feature helps manage spam and ensures fair network participation.

## 💰 How to Change Your Toll Amount

Update the toll amount that other users must pay to send you a message or payment. This helps you control spam and manage who can contact you freely.

### Steps: Changing Your Toll

1. Go to **⚙️ Settings** -> **Toll**.  
4. View your **Current Toll Amount** at the top of the screen.  
5. In the **Set New Toll Amount** section, enter your desired toll in **USD**.  
6. Tap **Save Changes** to apply the update.

### Important

- Liberdus automatically **converts your toll from USD into LIB** at the current exchange rate.  
- Setting your toll to **0.000000 USD** removes toll requirements and allows open messaging.  
- The **minimum toll is 0.2000 USD** - entering a lower amount will show an error and cannot be saved.  
- The toll only applies to users who **haven’t added you** as a Friend or Connection, or who you have set to **Tolled**.

> To prevent all **unsolicited messages**, set a **higher toll** and to allow **open communication**, set your toll to **0 USD**.

## 💸 How to Reclaim a Toll After 7 Days

If you send a message with a toll and the recipient does not reply, you can reclaim the unused toll after **7 days**. This ensures your funds are never permanently lost if the other person ignores or abandons the conversation.

### Steps: Reclaiming a Toll

1. Wait **7 full days** from the time the toll message was sent.  
2. Open the **chat** with the recipient.  
3. Simply **open and close** the chat window - no action button is required.  
4. Liberdus will automatically **return any unclaimed toll amount** to your wallet.  

The remaining toll funds will be refunded back to your balance.

### Rules & Explanations

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|--------------|
| **7-day wait is mandatory** | Reclaiming is only possible after the full 7-day period has passed. |
| **No reply = reclaimable** | If the recipient never replies, you can reclaim 100% of the toll. |
| **Partial reply = partial payout** | If they read or reply, they may earn part of the toll, and only the unused portion is reclaimable. |
| **Reclaim happens automatically** | There is no button - opening and closing the chat triggers the refund logic. |
| **No new messages** | If you send another message before the 7 days are up, the countdown resets. |

### How Toll Reclaim Works

| Scenario | Recipient Action | Your Reclaim |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **They never read or reply** | No interaction | 💯 Reclaim **100%** |
| **They read but don’t reply** | Seen message | 💰 Reclaim **50%** |
| **They reply** | Responded | 🚫 Reclaim **0%** *(no reclaim possible)* |

### Important

- Reclaiming a toll is **silent** - the other person is **not notified**.  
- You do **not** need to type, press, or send anything - simply open the chat after 7 days.  
- This system helps prevent spam while ensuring your **funds are always protected** if the conversation never occurs.
