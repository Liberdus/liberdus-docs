# 📘 Glossary

A concise reference for key technical and economic terms used in the **Liberdus** ecosystem.

---

### 💼 Validator  
A network participant who locks LIB tokens to process transactions, produce receipts, and maintain consensus. Validators can exist as either active or standby nodes.

### 🟢 Active Node  
A validator node currently participating in consensus and transaction validation. It directly increases the network’s throughput, storage, and bandwidth capacity while earning staking rewards.

### 🟠 Standby Node  
A validator node that is synced with the network but not currently active in validation. It waits to be rotated into the active set and does not earn rewards until it becomes an active node.

### 🗄️ Archiver Node  
A specialized node type responsible for storing the full network history and state. It does not validate transactions but ensures data integrity and long-term reliability.

### 🔁 Node Rotation  
The periodic process that swaps active and standby nodes. This ensures fairness, decentralization, and prevents any single node from remaining active indefinitely preventing various attacks such as Sybil attacks.

### ⚖️ S:A Ratio (Standby-to-Active Ratio)  
A parameter defining the ratio of standby to active nodes. It determines how long nodes spend in each state and helps balance scalability, rewards, and network resilience.

### ⏱️ Cycle  
A short, recurring time interval—about one minute—during. 

### 💰 Staking  
The act of locking LIB tokens as collateral to participate in network validation. It secures the network and allows validators to earn rewards. Staking on Liberdus is denominated in USD but staked in actual LIB.

### 🧾 Unstaking  
The process of withdrawing a validator’s staked LIB after leaving the active set. Validators must wait a few cycles before unstaking becomes available.

### 💎 Top-Up  
An optional amount staked above the minimum requirement. It provides a buffer to prevent ejection from the network if slashed or the minimum staking requirement is raised.

### ⚡ Slashing  
A penalty applied to validators that act maliciously or fail to perform duties. A portion of their staked LIB is burned to maintain honesty and reliability.

### 💵 Stable Price  
An oracle-based system that pegs staking requirements to a stable USD value over a 7 day moving average. It keeps validator costs predictable even when the LIB price fluctuates.

### 🪶 Proof of Quorum Optimistic (PoQo)  
Liberdus’s consensus protocol that achieves agreement efficiently within sharded networks. It uses collector nodes to aggregate votes, reducing communication overhead.

### 🛡️ Proof of Stake (PoS)  
Liberdus’s Sybil deterrence mechanism requiring validators to lock LIB tokens as economic collateral. It aligns incentives and secures the network against fake identities.

### 🏛️ LDAO (Liberdus DAO)  
The decentralized governance body of Liberdus. Token holders can propose and vote on network upgrades, parameters, and other major decisions.

### 🗳️ Governance Vote  
An on-chain voting process through which LDAO members decide on proposals. 

### 🪙 LIB (Liberdus Token)  
The native currency of the Liberdus network used for transactions, staking, tolls, and governance. It is deflationary over the long term due to continuous fee and penalty burns.

### 💸 Toll  
A small, user-defined fee required to send unsolicited messages. It prevents spam and allows creators or influencers to monetize incoming communication.

### 🔥 Fee Burning  
The permanent removal of LIB tokens through transaction and toll fees. This creates continuous deflation and long-term token scarcity.

### 🧾 Transaction Fee  
A small LIB payment made to process a message or transaction on the network.

### 🧠 Collector Node  
A temporarily selected active node responsible for aggregating votes within its shard during consensus. It compiles results and broadcasts a finalized receipt to all nodes.

### 🔐 Quorum  
The minimum number of validator votes required to achieve consensus within a shard. It ensures that decisions reflect a majority agreement of honest nodes.

### 🌍 Shard  
A subset of the Liberdus network containing a group of nodes responsible for processing a portion of total transactions and state data. Shards enable parallel execution and scalability.

### 🧱 Dynamic State Sharding  
A sharding method where each node holds a changing subset of the network state. It allows linear scalability and automatic load balancing across all nodes.

### 🧱 Static State Sharding  
A fixed sharding model where each shard permanently handles the same portion of state data. It improves scalability but lacks flexibility compared to dynamic sharding.

### 🌐 Network Sharding  
The division of network nodes into smaller groups, each operating independently. It improves scalability by reducing load per node.

### 💳 Transaction Sharding  
A distribution model where each shard processes a subset of all transactions. It increases throughput but does not address overall storage limitations.

### ⚙️ Horizontal Scaling  
The process of increasing network capacity by adding more nodes rather than upgrading hardware. Each additional node improves TPS, storage, and bandwidth.

### 📈 Linear Scaling  
A scaling model where each node contributes equally to performance growth. This ensures predictable network expansion without bottlenecks.

### 🔧 Autoscaling  
A mechanism that automatically adjusts the number of nodes based on network demand. The network expands or contracts dynamically through node voting and consensus.

### 🧩 Stepwise Scaling  
A limited scaling model found in static-shard systems where new shards are created only after old ones are full. It causes network jumps rather than smooth growth.
