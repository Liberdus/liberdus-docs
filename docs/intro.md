# Introduction

Liberdus is a decentralized messaging and payment platform designed for privacy, scalability, and resilience. It combines secure communication with cryptocurrency transactions, allowing users to send messages and LIB tokens in a single operation.

The network operates without centralized servers, instead relying on a distributed set of validator nodes powered by the Shardus protocol. This architecture enables horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and censorship resistance.

All messages on Liberdus are protected by quantum-resistant end-to-end encryption, ensuring long-term data confidentiality even against future quantum computing threats. The platform is anonymous and users can create multiple accounts without phone numbers, emails, or personal identifiers.

## Core Features

- **Quantum Encryption** - All communications are end-to-end encrypted using a hybrid of classical and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, ensuring security against both current and next-generation threats.

- **Spam Free** - The unsolicited messages from unknown parties pay you to read and respond.

- **Global Decentralization** - The platform runs on a distributed network of validator nodes rather than centralized servers. This eliminates single points of failure and provides censorship resistance by design.

- **Messaging Monetization** - Users can configure fees for incoming messages from unknown senders. Payments are triggered upon message read and response, creating a built-in spam deterrent and incentive mechanism.

- **Scalability** - Liberdus achieves high throughput and low latency through the Shardus protocol’s sharded consensus and load-balancing system. The network’s performance improves as new nodes join.

- **Open Source** - All major components of the platform are open source, allowing public inspection, verification, and contribution. Trust is placed in transparent code rather than centralized authority.
